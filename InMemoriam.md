# In Memoriam #


QDecimal library is dedicated to cherished memory of my late uncle:

**Muharrem Saffet Bozkurt**

He was a schizophrenia sufferer in most of his adult life. That terrible illness robbed him simple things in life that we take as granted and aren't even aware of.

He passed away on November 2006, aged 59. He is _sadly_ missed.
